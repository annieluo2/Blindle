                  <p>There are approximately 285 million people in the world that are visually impaired, with about 39 million who are legally blind. Braille reading materials are hard to come by and are often expensive because of the process needed to print them, which is why the system is being taught less and less to those who would need it to read. Blindle hopes to provide a cheap, easy, and portable way for those who are visually impaired to access reading materials that previously would only be widely available through an audio output function. </p>

                  <p>The team will design and prototype an e-reader tablet that takes in text files which it then translates to braille and outputs to a display, where each braille character contains of six electrodes that provide stimulation rather than the physical studs typically found in braille devices. We hope to eventually build a display consisting of an array approximately 14 letters across and 6 letters down with a narrow bar on the left to allow for optimal location tracking on the user’s end. 5 push-buttons will be utilized to go forward and backward between pages, return to the home page to select reading options, and turn the e-reader on/off. A potentiometer will be used to toggle the intensity of the electrical output. In order to place reading materials onto the reader, an application will need to be developed that allows for the downloading of text and subsequent translation into braille. </p>

                    We have split up Blindle into three primary components and have been focusing on developing a small scale model of 2x4 braille cells as a proof of concept:

                  <ol type="1">

                    <li>the signal select to determine which individual nodes need to be set high</li>
                    <li>the electrotactile stimulation of each node</li>
                  </ol>

                    Web Application
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    On the computer, we have programmed a GUI to convert a PDF into a text file using the Python library ‘pdfminer’. The resulting text output is placed onto an external SD card that is wired up to an mBed via one of its SPI interfaces. From there, this text file is read in and using a lookup table in C++, each individual character is translated into a 3x2 array acting as a braille character and placed within a larger array that will be cycled through by the signal select. For the text to braille translation, the braille signals are represented by a 3x2 boolean array, whereby a False value corresponds to a pin that is turned off in a 3x2 braille cell and a True value corresponds to a pin that is activated. The program translates the braille character-by-character by first grabbing a string from the text being read, iterating through each character, using a lookup table to find its corresponding boolean representation, and outputting the signals to the device.

                    Electrotactle Stimulation
                  </h5>                  
                  <p>
                    The crux of the Blindle project is being able to stimulate the nerves in a user’s finger to apply a phantom sensation of pressure, in lieu of a physical Braille pad. Sensation is directly tied to the current encountered by the nerves, which in turn is dependent upon how much power can be coupled through the skin. Blindle charges capacitors to a variable voltage that is specified by the user usually in the range of 60-100V, to deliver an electric impulse to the nerves in the user’s fingertips. While this voltage may seem large, the high impedance of human skin (which itself is a function of environmental and genetic factors) limits the resulting current to safe levels, usually no more than a couple of milliamps. This in turn provides a sensation akin to a small finger prick or a slight tingle.
                  </p>
                  <img src="images/node.png" width="40%" height="40%" class="center"/> 
                  <p>
                    Braille elements are charged by the signal select system, where the capacitor holds this charge until it is discharged when a finger passes across a metal pad connected to the capacitor.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h5>

                  </h5> 
                  <p>
                    Individual Braille elements are selected with a cross-power array that is controlled by a microcontroller (LPC1768) and two shift registers. Each shift register takes inputs from the output pins of the microcontroller, and shifts up to one byte of data between its output pins, allowing for sequential selection. In our cross-power array, one shift register is used to select columns and one shift register is used to control rows. By operating these shift registers at different speeds, it is possible to loop through all elements in each column before moving to the next column.
                  </p>
                  <img src="images/select.png" width="40%" height="40%" class="center"/>                  
                  <p>
                    Each shift register output is tied to the base of a transistor that is used to drive a relay. These relays are used to switch on and off the charging of capacitors that are used for sensation. While typically MOSFETs are used for switching signals, the large voltages and changing voltage across the capacitor being charged at each Braille cell make relays a more logical choice.

                    After we finish our prototype of a 2x4 demux array to show our software works and a single braille cell powered by shift registers and relays to show the electrotactile stimulation working, we hope that the two concepts can be integrated together to have a small scale working model. In order to make this full scale, there would be a few things to take into consideration. First, the power that the large scale version would require means that the product would have to be plugged in constantly, thus defeating the purpose of a portable device. Also, the rate at which the software is able to clock and the capacitors are able to charge would have to be closely timed to ensure that nothing is missed i.e. if a finger is run over a node without it being fully charged so nothing is able to be felt or if the row and columns both fire high but hit the intersecting node at different times and is not registered.
